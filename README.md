# Templates for SCSS
The 7-1 pattern as described at [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) 
is used for the templates. The orginal boilerplate by Kitty Giraudel can be found here [here](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-boilerplate).

## [basic-7-1](scss/basic-7-1/)
The basic-7-1 template contains only the 7-1 structure and no scss code.

## [extended-7-1](scss/extended-7-1/)
Extends the basic-7-1 template by some default scss code, like [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css).
